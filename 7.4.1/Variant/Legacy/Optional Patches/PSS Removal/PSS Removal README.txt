In Gen 4, the Physical/Special Split (PSS) was implemented. This made moves like Thunderpunch, which in Gens 1-3 was considered a Special move, into a Physical move since it is a punch not a lightning bolt. This is enabled by default in Emerald Final, but it does inherently unbalance the game, since for example all dark-type moves without the PSS are Special, and all the available ones in Gen 3 WITH the PSS are Physical. Applying this option removes the PSS making the types as follows:

Physical: Normal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, Ghost, Steel
Special: Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, Dark
