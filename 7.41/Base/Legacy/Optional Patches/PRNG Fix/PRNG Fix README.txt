The PRNG Fix makes changes to the in-game random chances (moves missing, which encounter on a route is trigged, etc) that make it work as intended. For those who don't know, Pokemon Emerald's Psuedo Random Number Generator (PRNG) is broken. Because of this, people can manipulate their actions to produce a desired result, such as wating for the precise moment to throw a pokeball to catch a pokemon at full health, or getting a pokemon with perfect IVs.

The casual player probably won't notice something like that, but a few people have requested this feature so I have added it as an option. 

Side note: The reason why it's called a PSUEDO Random Number Generator is because computers aren't able to do purely random things, so the way it is accomplished is by making an algorithm that outputs seemingly unrelated numbers based on a start point (called a SEED) determined when you open the game/turn on the device. This means that if you knew the exact algorithm and the seed, you would have access to all the "random" results, and cheat accordingly. The reason Emerald's PRNG is broken is because it does not "re-seed", every time you start the game, it uses the exact same seed so it is able to be predicted and therefore abused. Those who have played games like Minecraft where you can choose your own seed can relate to this; if you use the same seed, you get the same world and can plan an optimal route, where rare resources spawn and such.
