Pick one of these three patches depending on which wild encounter list you want. Vanilla wilds... Has the Vanilla Wilds, Vanilla Wilds Plus includes version exclusives from Ruby/Sapphire. New Wilds has all 386 pokemon available. Do NOT patch more than one of these main patches to the same ROM. Do optional patches after.

Legacy does NOT have anything from Generation 4 so no Leafeon or Electivire or Leaf Guard or Motor Drive.
