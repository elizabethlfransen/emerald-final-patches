The Hidden Abilities option adds in secondary abilities to Pokemon that only have one in vanilla but gained a Hidden Ability in later gens that existed in Gen 3. Example: Caterpie in vanilla ONLY has the Shield Dust ability, but in later gens it has Run Away as a Hidden Ability, so if you add the Hidden Abilities option, Caterpie will have Shield Dust and Run Away. BUT Butterfree will not have Tinted Lens since even though it has that as a Hidden Ability in later gens, it is an ability that does not exist in Gen 3.

The Modern Stats option updates the Base Stats for Pokemon who have had them changed in later gens. Example: in Gen VI, Pikachu had both its Defense and Special Defense increased by 10.

Both the vanilla and changed abilities, as well as the list of changed base stats are listed in the Documentation Folder.

The reason these are together is because they are part of the same block of data so it's more reliable to change the whole thing rather than multiple overlapping sections.
